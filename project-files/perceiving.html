          Upon being asked to just sit in my dorm room 
          and note down everything that I see and feel, I mostly felt anxious, 
          nervous, and many other negative emotions. Although this tiny dorm room 
          is my shelter and personal space from everything outside, I have 
          only moved into this room seven months ago and have to share this 
          space with a roommate and 5 other suite mates. Thus, I have never 
          actually felt comfortable and at peace in my share of the room.
          While researching about the psychology behind this feeling of 
          being watched, I found out that different people feel different 
          ranges of this feelings from just being uncomfortable to actually 
          being able to see visions that scare them. I was intrigued by this 
          wide range of emotions/imaginations, so I wanted to illustrate the 
          extreme vision I see when I feel people's gazes.

          Using black and 
          white acrylic paint, I covered a two sided open room without 
          focusing too intensely on the details in order to convey the 
          feeling of uncertainly and unfamiliarity with the space. I then 
          carved out some 'frames' in the walls in which the acrylic painted
          eyeballs peek through the open hole. To intensify the contrast of 
          the eyeballs being hidden in the light and seen in the dark, I 
          attached string lights around the backside of the frames. When 
          the room becomes dark and the light shining the eyes are turned on, 
          the eyes almost seem like hallucinations that frighten and scare 
          the viewers. The wooden chair in the center of the ground allows 
          the viewers to put themselves down onto the chair and experience 
          the feeling of being watched all around them. The angles of the 
          pupils and the white lines flowing to the legs of the chair all 
          present uneasiness and anxiety to the audience who experience 
          this work. Through my work, I tried to emphasize and visually 
          recreate the feeling I'm surrounded by everyday, hoping people 
          who get similar feelings can empathize and relate to my work.
